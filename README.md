# PhotoMapper

PhotoMapper is a simple mobile application that allows you to take pictures and view them in a list or on a map. This app is meant as an example of how to organize and build a Cordova app. See more about Cordova here: [http://incubator.apache.org/cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/).

This project will evovle over a series of blog posts at: [http://neilgoodman.net](http://neilgoodman.net). All blog posts will be filed under the Cordova category.

Run the following commands in a command-line terminal in the projects root directory (where `grunt.js` is located):

    npm install
    npm run-script grunt

This will compile the LESS, JavaScript, and HTML components and copy them to the www folder located in both the Android and iOS projects.

### Android Build

The Android build phase depends on either ant or Eclipse and the Android SDK. To get ant installed for you platform, visit the ant website: [http://ant.apache.org](http://ant.apache.org/). Eclipse can be installed form the Eclipse website: [http://www.eclipse.org](http://www.eclipse.org/). Follow these directions on the Android Developer site to get up and running with the Android SDK: [http://developer.android.com/sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/).

You will need to complete the JavaScript Build phase before you continue with the Android Build phase.
